# Connect 4: Ancient Greece

Designed ancient Greek-themed Connect 4 application with multiple features including: 3 player mode, "Play the Gods" (user vs computer), bonus power up function, and hidden trap function. The additional power up/trap functions 
tip the favor of the game in different directions. Where the power up will allow for an extra move for the user who triggered it, the hidden trap ends the game for both users so should be avoided at all times.
